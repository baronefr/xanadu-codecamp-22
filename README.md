## How to Install:
1. Create a pip environment called `codecamp`:
``python3 -m venv codecamp``
2. Activate the environment:
``source ./codecamp/bin/activate``
3. Install the required packages from `./requirements.txt`:
``python3 -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt``
## Challenges:
* 1 ***Differentiable ZNE: Noisy Circuits***
  Build a quantum circuit with noise.

* 2 ***Fourier spectrum of quantum modelss: Build a model***
  We introduce the basics of building quantum models with classical input data.

* 3 ***Gradients: The parameter-shift rule***
  Implement your own simple parameter-shift rule for the Pauli rotation gates.

* 4 ***Quantum transforms and noise: Energy dissipation***
  We use quantum transforms to add energy dissipation to every gate in a single-wire circuit. We study the effects of energy dissipation in the purity of the final states.

* 5 ***Universality: Working with one qubit***
  In this challenge we will work with the definition of universality in one qubit

* 6 ***Differentiable ZNE: Global circuit folding***
  Implement a global circuit folding routine

* 7 ***Fourier spectrum of quantum models - Distance in Fourier space***
  In this challenge, we write a script that gives us a notion of how well a quantum model fits a given function.

* 8 ***Gradients: A four-term parameter-shift rule***
  Implement your own parameter-shift rule for the controlled X/Y/Z gates

* 9 ***Quantum transforms and noise: A faulty superconducting device***
  We use quantum transforms to model a faulty real-life superconducting device.

* 10 ***Universality: U3 and CNOT decomposition***
  This time there will be more qubits. In this challenge we willtry to define a given matrix with only U3 and CNOT gates.
