    "# Differentiable ZNE: Noisy circuits\n",
    "#### Challenge (1/15)\n",
    "#### 100 points\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we simulate quantum circuits, we can do so under the most ideal circumstances, i.e. without needing to worry about noise. In practice, implementing, say, a Pauli $Z$ gate on today's hardware isn't as easy as writing `qml.PauliZ`; what ends up actually being implemented is an operation that's close to `qml.PauliZ` because, in some way, real-world noise is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to combat noise, including a technique called zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). We will work more with ZNE later! But, on the path towards fault-tolerant quantum computing, we must inevitably understand noise in order to combat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "PennyLane offers the ability to _simulate_ different types of noise that are present in quantum devices. One such type of noise is called a _bitflip error_. A _bitflip error_, occuring with a probability $p$\n",
    "on a given single qubit, is an error resulting in the state of a qubit being accidentally flipped. Check out [this demo](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_noisy_circuits.html#noisy-operations) to learn more about modelling noise in PennyLane!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you'll implement a two-qubit circuit that contains bitflip errors on each of the qubits to see how the resulting quantum state drifts from that of the noise-less/error-free circuit. To do so, the [fidelity](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.math.fidelity.html?highlight=fidelity) between the respective states for various bitflip probabilities $p$ will be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge code\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code below contains a few functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `circuit`: A quantum circuit that contains a Hadamard and CNOT gate.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/grader-service-content-production/challenge-images/explorer_differentiable_ZNE/circuit.png\" alt=\"Hadamard and CNOT gate\" style=\"height: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* `bitflip_circuit`: A quantum circuit that must be exactly like `circuit`, with the exception of bitflip errors on each qubit. **You must complete this function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/grader-service-content-production/challenge-images/explorer_differentiable_ZNE/noisy_circuit.png\" alt=\"Hadamard and CNOT gate Noisy\" style=\"height: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* `fidelities`: This function returns the quantum fidelity between the resulting states from the circuits mentioned above for various bitflip probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "As input to this problem, you are given a list of probabilities $p$ (`list(float)`) that define bitflip probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "This code will output the `fidelities` (`list(float)`) between the error-free circuit's state and that of the circuits with bitflip errors given by the input probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"`. Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"
